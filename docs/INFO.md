# CozyNSM Additional Information

## Offline Install
This project has been designed to be built in an offline environment, and therefore contains all necessary software and dependencies. The reasons for this are many. There are many interconnected components and open source software changes so often, bleeding edge builds often break. This stack often supports critical operations, where the number one priority is that this platform works. This entire stack is designed to operate in a passive/offline environment, so outdated software at worst case having security vulnerabilities will be largely irrelevant. With all that being said, in maintaining CozyNSM there will be regular updates as the latest software is built and tested.
